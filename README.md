## Background

### Naming

Over the years, many english-speaking friends and colleagues have asked me how they were supposed to pronounce my first name. And I would respond that I really did not care if my name was butchered, and that I respond from anything from Erwin, to Edward and even Owen.

One colleague insisted until I told him that pronouncing it "like Air Force One minus the force" was as close as he was ever going get. He then proceed to call me "Air Force One" the whole day.

So because this is a selfish project that only serves my own needs, I decided to name it after myself.

### Needs

As more and more of my working life is spent typing increasing complex commands into a terminal window, I found myself in need of an easier way of storing and retrieving increasingly arcane incantations. The `air1` project was born out of this need.
